## Design Metrics

This revolutionary product is ideal for applying ammonium nitrate (ice gel packs) to your swollen joint. 
- The temperature status of the ice is sent to your phone via bluetooth.
- If the ice is below melting point, it will turn on a green LED. 
- If it is above melting point, it will turn on a green LED. 
Therefore, you can monitor the condition of your ice pack 24/7 using both the LEDs and the bluetooth functionality, and be notified of when it needs to be changed. 

#### The device was strategically engineered using the following components: 
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- TMP Sensor
- 1.5V LEDs
- Breadboard
